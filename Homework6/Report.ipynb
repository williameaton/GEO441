    "This equation can then be solved by expressing each term as a function of a local elemental domain $\\xi \\in [-1, +1]$. The mapping for each element is expressed in terms of linear shape functions as: \n",

    "Knowing that the shape functions are 2-element vectors of $N^1 = [1,0]$ and $N^2 = [0,1]$, It is relatively easy to evaluate the 2D matrices for $m^e$ and $k^e$ assuming that $\\kappa, \\: \\rho$ and $c_p$ remain constant within an element.

    "Assembly of the global matrices can be done efficiently for each element by looping through $n$ elements and adding the local matrices as follows:\n",

    "where the lower case indices are the local (2x1 or 2x2) arrays and the capital letters are the global arrays. To do this looping method requires that the global arrays have dimension of (n+1 x 1 or n+1 x n+1). To remove this extra element/row/column at the end we can then just slice the arrays - ensuring that the n+1 element of arrays like the temperature are not affected (by only using the first n (or n x n) elements of the above global arrays) implements the RHS boundary condition as, when looping in time, the velocity is kept at 0 and therefore the last node (array element - the RHS boundary) is not updated/stays fixed.\n",

The resulting animation is shown below: "

    "## Problem 2: \n",
    "\n",
    "The script for Problem 2 is in ```Problem2.py```. It also uses a class in ```classes.py``` which is called ```Ocean_diffusion```. This class is basically the same as the ```Diffusion``` class (I copied and pasted it!) but with some extra stuff. If I wasn't so behind on other work I would have written them into one single, flexible class or as inherited classes of an ABC sorry! Another small class called ```Isotherm``` is used to help plot some isotherms that I thought would look cool. However, to clearly see the isotherm structure you need to use a lot of elements (~500). This is computationally fine but seems to produce a small instability near the surface which decays through time. This instability is not present when there are fewer elements (e.g 100) or if a smaller timestep is used (e.g. 0.05) which can be set in ```Problem2.py```. So in conclusion I think this is maybe due to having too many elements for a given timestep (which is weird given I thought it would be unconditionally stable), instead of a problem with the boundary condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second plot on each animation is a number of isotherms (or rather, plotting the y value at which the array index closest to 200$^o C$, 400$^o C$, etc... are for each timestep (iteration). When there are few elements, as in the first two examples, it doesnt really show a clear picture. However using a high number of elements shows the isotherm evolution through time. If we define the base of the lithosphere as some critical temperature, say 600 degrees, then this maps out the lithospheric thickness through time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, here are some examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: \n",
    "The first example uses 10 elements as per the homework request. It is not a great approximation but the boundary conditions etc are honoured - however if you continue to run the simulation for a very long time then there are discrepencies between the Finite Element and analytical solutions at depth (highest temperatures). I think this is because the analytical solution uses a boundary condition at $x = \\infty$ where as the FEM uses a boundary condition at $x = 20$ and hence there are differences through time. "
