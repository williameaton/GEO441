    "* The finite different method is less stable in the region surrounding the heterogeneity interface than the pseudospectral solution (which is visible in the small oscillatory shape of the finite-difference wave around the boundary) \n",
    "* The pseudospectal method boundaries behave seperately to the finite difference Neumann boundaries. I believe that the reason for this is that the two boundaries are intrinsically linked due to the periodicity of the Fourier basis. The result is that the energy that leaves the LHS boundary enters the domain from the RHS and vice versa - in the case of a homogenous medium with a source at the centre, this resembles a Neumann boundary. However when the phases reach each boundary at different times (due to heterogenous speeds in the domain) this effect is evident. To emphasise this I attach a second animation below of a source that is not central in a (homogenous) domain below\n"

    "In the above simulation it is clear that the phase leaving the RHS boudary reappears on the LHS boundary. Due to the size of the boundary, we can also see that the inital pulse which propagates in the negative $x$ direction travels at a different wavespeed for the pseudospectral and finite-difference solvers. I think this is due to numerical dispersion resulting from the different $c_{grid}$ wavespeeds (dispersion equations) for the two solvers. "
