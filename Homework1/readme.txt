I tried to keep this code modular but it ended up being a bit over-complicated sorry! The files 1homogenous.py
and 2heterogenous.py need to be run to produce the results requested in the problem set.

All the other files are used for the calculations. They all use relative imports so will need to be in the same directory
as you are running from.
