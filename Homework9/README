Whats in the repo? - edited by WE 
==================================
The main report/results are in ```report.ipynb```. 

Directory ```visualisation``` has a couple of scripts/subdirectories: 
1) compare_seismograms [subdir]: holds some data from simulations and  
     the pngs in the report
2) plot_snapshots.py: code to produce animations in report. Requires 
     loading data from a folder called OUTPUT_FILES/reduced
3) plot_traces.py: code to produce the pngs shown in the report 
4) PSV.mp4: Video in report
5) reduce_data_redundancy: script that takes the output snapshots in 
     OUTPUT_FILES from simulation and outputs an edited verion of the
     data in OUTPUT_FILES/reduced/
     The reason for this is that each snapshot holds the x,z coordinates
     and these are the same in each file, meaning a lot of unneeded data. 
     reduce_data_redundancy takes the snapshots and removes the coords, 
     storing them in a seperate file called coords, within the reduced
     directory. 
     This needs to be run before running the animation script. 
6) SH.mp4: Video in report
